# CSS Layout Fix Applied

## Problem Identified
The services section had **nested grid layouts** causing cards to overlap:
- `.section__layout` creates 2 columns (intro | content)
- `.section__content--features` was trying to create another 2 columns (cards | bento)
- `.feature-grid` was trying to create 3 columns of cards
- Result: 3 levels of nested grids = broken layout with overlapping text

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Content Layout
```css
.section__content--features {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;  /* Changed from 2 columns to 1 */
  gap: clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3rem);
}
```

### 2. Made Feature Cards Responsive
```css
.feature-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(320px, 100%), 1fr));
  gap: clamp(1.5rem, 3vw, 2rem);
}
```

### 3. Added Desktop Optimization
```css
@media (min-width: 1400px) {
  .feature-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
  }
}
```

### 4. Fixed Bento Positioning
```css
.feature-grid__bento {
  min-height: clamp(24rem, 38vw, 32rem);
  margin-top: 1rem;
}
```

## Result
✅ Cards no longer overlap
✅ Text is readable and properly spaced
✅ Layout stacks vertically: intro → cards → bento
✅ Responsive on all screen sizes
✅ 2-column cards on large desktops (1400px+)
