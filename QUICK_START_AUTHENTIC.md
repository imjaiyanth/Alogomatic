## ‚úèÔ∏è Things You MUST Customize

### 1. Update SEO Component

In `src/components/SEO.tsx`:

```tsx
const DEFAULT_SEO = {
  title: 'Your Name | Full-Stack Developer & 3D/IoT/AI Specialist',
  description: 'Building 3D product configurators, IoT mobile apps, and AI workflows. 5+ applications, 50+ AI agents. React ‚Ä¢ Node.js ‚Ä¢ Python',
  image: '/og-image.png', // Create this!
  url: 'https://yourdomain.com', // Your actual domain
  type: 'website'
};
```

### 2. Update Contact Email

In `ContactSection.tsx`:

```tsx
<a href="mailto:your-actual-email@domain.com">
  your-actual-email@domain.com
</a>
```

### 3. Update Brand Name

**Decision needed:** What do you want to call yourself?

Options:
1. **Your Name** (e.g., "John Smith - Developer")
2. **Alogomatic** (from your GitHub repo)
3. **Something New**

**Current in code:** "Alogomatic"

### 4. Update Form Endpoint

In `src/hooks/useContactForm.ts`:

```tsx
const response = await fetch('YOUR_FORM_SERVICE_URL', {
  // Options:
  // - Formspree.io (easiest)
  // - Web3Forms
  // - Your own API
});
```

### 5. Add Real Images

Replace placeholders in `CaseStudiesSection.tsx`:
```tsx
image: '/placeholder-3d-config.jpg'  // Replace with real screenshots
```

## üé® Tone Customization

The authentic content uses a **direct, technical** tone. Adjust if needed:

### Current Tone:
```
"I build 3D product configurators, IoT mobile apps, and AI 
automation workflows. 5 applications delivered, 50+ AI agents deployed."
```

### More Casual:
```
"Hey! I'm a developer who loves building 3D configurators, 
IoT apps, and AI automation. I've shipped 5 apps and created 
50+ AI workflows."
```

### More Professional:
```
"Full-stack developer specializing in 3D visualization, 
IoT application development, and AI-powered automation. 
Portfolio includes 5 production applications and 50+ 
deployed AI workflows."
```

**Choose what feels authentic to YOU.**

---

## üîç Content Decisions to Make

### 1. How Much to Share?

**Option A - Specific (Recommended):**
```
"5 applications delivered"
"50+ AI workflows built"
"10,000+ IoT devices managed"
```

**Option B - General:**
```
"Multiple applications delivered"
"Extensive AI workflow experience"
"Large-scale IoT deployments"
```

**My recommendation:** Be specific. It's more credible.

---

### 2. Solo vs. Team Language?

**Option A - Solo (Honest):**
```
"I work independently and bring in specialists when needed."
```

**Option B - Flexible (Neutral):**
```
"I lead projects and collaborate with specialists as needed."
```

**Option C - Vague (Not Recommended):**
```
"We deliver..." (implies team when there isn't one)
```

**My recommendation:** Use "I" unless you have a consistent team.

---

### 3. Which Skills to Emphasize?

**Your unique combination:**
1. 3D Product Configurators (rare skill)
2. IoT Mobile Apps (differentiates you)
3. 50+ AI Workflows (proof of expertise)
4. Full-Stack Development (foundation)

**Hierarchy:**
```
Primary: 3D Configurators (most unique)
Secondary: IoT Mobile Apps (differentiates)
Tertiary: AI Workflows (trending, 50+ is impressive)
Foundation: Full-Stack (everyone has this)
```

**Lead with what makes you different.**

4. **The Timeline Question:**
   - Client asks: "How long will this take?"
   - Set realistic expectations (4-12 weeks)

5. **The Budget Question:**

## üé¨ Next Steps

1. **Review** the `.authentic.tsx` files
2. **Customize** with your actual info
3. **Test** locally with `pnpm dev`
4. **Get feedback** from a friend/colleague
5. **Deploy** when ready

---

## üí¨ Need Help Deciding?

### Ask yourself:

1. **Does this feel honest?**
   - If not, we adjust

2. **Does this showcase my best work?**
   - 3D, IoT, 50+ AI workflows

3. **Would I hire this person based on this site?**
   - If not, what's missing?

4. **Is this how I want to be known?**
   - The "3D/IoT/AI specialist" positioning

---

## ü§ù Final Thoughts

**Your current site** positions you as a generic consulting firm.

**The authentic version** positions you as a specialized developer with unique skills.

**Both can work**, but one is honest and the other isn't.

The authentic version:
- ‚úÖ Sets correct expectations
- ‚úÖ Highlights your unique skills
- ‚úÖ Attracts right-fit clients
- ‚úÖ Builds trust through honesty

**You decide which feels right.**
